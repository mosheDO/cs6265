This class is an intense, hands-on security laboratory. As a student, I
practiced reverse engineering to discover security vulnerabilities in
executable files. This course covers the use of advanced techniques to write
exploits for different families of vulnerabilities. More documentation will
come as I continue to digest the content of this course.

## Labs

The labs submodule contains the class's lab challenges and my solutions. This
